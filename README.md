# Tech Hour - jOOQ

## About
**TechHour-jOOQ** is a lightweight Kotlin + Gradle project that demonstrates how to use **jOOQ** for type-safe SQL with **PostgreSQL**, **Flyway** for schema migrations, and **Testcontainers** for integration testing.

Itâ€™s a hands-on example of how to:
- Configure and generate jOOQ classes with Gradle
- Manage database migrations via Flyway
- Run integration tests using containerized PostgreSQL
- Develop a clean, strongly-typed data access layer in Kotlin
